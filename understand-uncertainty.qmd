# Understanding Uncertainty in Ecological Forecasts {#sec-under-unc}

Ecological forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting changes in populations, communities, and ecosystems. Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Forecast uncertainty is derived from multiple sources, including model parameters and driver data, among others. Knowing the uncertainty associated with a forecast enables forecast users to evaluate the forecast and make more informed decisions. Ecological forecasters develop and update forecasts using the iterative forecasting cycle, in which they make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; and use the model to make a forecast of future conditions and quantify forecast uncertainty. There are a number of approaches that forecasters can use to reduce uncertainty, which will be explored in this module.

## Option: code based assignment

This chapter sets the foundation for @sec-second-forecast. In prep for @sec-second-forecast, there is code-based version of this chapter that provides example code and introduces key that will guide your work adding uncertainty to your forecast from @sec-first-forecast.

The code-based assignment will require you to create a GitHub repository with your completed code from the NEON Forecasting Challenge workshop @sec-first-forecast. You will build on this repository throughout the rest of section 1 of the book. You can learn more about setting up Git and GitHub in @sec-github.
