# Advanced forecasting

The advanced forecasting section applies the concepts of the first section to a process model. The topics include an introduction to process modeling (particularly dynamic models), model fitting through likelihood and Bayesian techniques, and data assimilation using the particle filter.

Material in this section is partially derived from the [forecasting activities](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities) associated with Mike Dietze's Ecological Forecasting book (@dietzeEcologicalForecasting2017) and his [terrestrial forecasting tutorial](https://github.com/mdietze/FluxCourseForecast) that was created for the NEON Ecological Forecasting Challenge.
