## Overview of model

We use a simple representation of a forest ecosystem that simulates carbon using three pools (leaves, wood, and soil). The model in @fig-process-model is a 0-D model (no horizontal and vertical dimensions) that runs at a 1-day timestep. It models carbon using the units of MgC/ha.

![Conceptual diagram of the forest model](img/model_diagram.png){#fig-process-model fig-align="center"}

Photosynthesis (gross primary productivity; `gpp`) is modeled using a light-use efficiency (LUE) approach. The goal of an LUE model is to convert light energy into carbon. First, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is converted to absorbed PAR. Since more PAR is absorbed when more leaves are present, the absorbed PAR increases with LAI. However, due to self-shading, there is a diminishing return on PAR absorbed as LAI increases. The function used looks like the following:

```{r}
#| echo: false
tibble(lai = seq(0,8, by = 0.1)) |> 
  mutate(aPAR = 1 - exp(-0.5 * lai)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = lai, y = aPAR)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Leaf area index (LAI)", y = "Fraction of PAR absorbed (aPAR)", title = "aPAR = 1 - exp(-0.5 * lai)") +
  theme_bw()
```

The absorbed PAR is multiplied by a light-use efficiency parameter (`alpha`) that converts the absorbed PAR to carbon. LAI is determined by multiplying leaf carbon by the specific leaf area parameter (`SLA`).

Autotrophic respiration (`ra`) is modeled as a constant proportion of GPP using the `Ra_frac` parameter. Net primary productivity (`npp`) is the carbon that is not used for autotrophic respiration (`gpp - ra`).

NPP is allocated to the two vegetation carbon states (`wood` and `leaves`) based on a constant proportion parameter. `leaf_frac` is the proportion that is allocated to leaves and `1-leaf_frac` is the allocation to wood.

Litterfall occurs between the starting day of the year (`litterfall_start`) and the ending day of the year (`litterfall_start + litterfall_length`). The annual proportion of leaves (`litterfall_rate`) that are dropped is removed during this period.

Tree mortality is modeled as a constant proportion of wood (`mortality`) that is lost each day.

Heterotrophic respiration is modeled as a constant proportion of soil carbon (`Rbasal`) that is adjusted by the temperature using a Q10 function that is governed by a Q10 parameter (`Q10`). The Q10 function represents how much respiration increases per 10-degree C increase in temperature. A Q10 parameter (`Q10`) of 2 corresponds to a doubling of respiration per 10-degree C increase in temperature. The Q10 function requires a base temperature (here, 20 degrees C) where the function evaluates to 1 and the represent rate equals the rate specified by `Rbasal`. The Q10 function looks like the following (using a `Q10` of 2):

```{r}
#| echo: false
tibble(temp = seq(10,40, by = 0.1)) |> 
  mutate(scaler = 2 ^ ((temp - 20)/10)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = temp, y = scaler)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (C)", y = "Respriation multipler", title = "multiplier = Q10 ^ ((temperature - 20)/10); Q10 = 2") +
  theme_bw()
```

The change in leaves at each time step is modeled as leaf allocation - litterfall. The change in wood in each timestep is modeled as wood allocation - mortality. The change in soil carbon in each timestep is modeled as litterfall + mortality - heterotrophic respiration.

Finally, net ecosystem exchange (`nee`) is modeled as `ra + rh - gpp` with negative values corresponding to a net gain in carbon by the ecosystem.

The model requires inputs of photosynthetic active radiation (`PAR`), air temperature (`temp`), and day-of-year (`doy`).

## Uncertainty

Uncertainty can be represented in the model through its use of multiple ensemble members and the addition of random noise to each model state at each time step. The ensemble members can differ in their initial starting point, their parameters, and their meteorological inputs. The ensembles members are represented in the model code using the vector capacities in R. For example `states[, 1]` represents all ensemble members (the rows of the state matrix) for state number 3 (the columns of the state matrix). A similar concept applies to the drivers (`inputs[, 1]`). The parameters (e.g. `parms$alpha`) are vectors with one value for each ensemble member.

Normally distributed random noise can be added to each state at each time step to represent "process uncertainty" (e.g., uncertainty due to the capacity of the model structure to reproduce the system). A unique value is drawn for each ensemble member following

```         
rnorm(ens_members, states[, 1] , parms$sigma.leaf)
```

where the mean of the normal distribution is the predicted value for the state at that time step and the standard deviation (e.g., `parms$sigma.leaf`) controls how much noise is added. `parms$sigma.leaf`, `parms$sigma.wood`, and `parms$sigma.soil` are parameters that are set by the user or estimated from a model calibration. Setting the sigma parameters to 0 removes the random noise (as done below). See @sec-prop-unc for more details on how uncertainty is represented and propagated through time in the model.

## Solving the model

At each time step, the processes that result in a change in the model states are calculated (i.e., photosynthesis, mortality, respiration, etc.). The process rates are then combined to determine the net rate of change (i.e., the derivative) for each model state.

```         
  dleaves_dt <- leaf_alloc  - litterfall
  dwood_dt <- wood_alloc  - mortality
  dSOM_dt <- litterfall + mortality - rh
```

The net rate of change for each time step is added to the value of the state at the previous time step to calculate the update state.

```         
  states[, 1] <- states[, 1] + dleaves_dt
  states[, 2] <- states[, 2] + dwood_dt
  states[, 3] <- states[, 3] + dSOM_dt
```

This process is repeated at each time step to create a time series of model output. This method is called the Euler method for solving ordinary differential equations and assumes a constant change in time (dt = 1 day) at each time step.

## Model as a function

The code below describes the model as an R function. The function predicts one-time step at a time. The same function is found in the `R/forecast_model.R` script in the book repository. The inputs to the function are:

-   `t`: the index of the current model time-step

-   `states`: a matrix of the states (rows = ensemble members, columns = states)

-   `parms`: a data frame of parameters (rows = ensemble members, columns = parameters)

-   `inputs`: a matrix of drivers (rows = ensemble members, columns = drivers)

```{r}
forest_model <- function(t, states, parms, inputs){
  
  ens_members <- nrow(states)
  
  inputs_temp <- inputs[, 1]
  inputs_PAR <- inputs[, 2]
  inputs_doy <- inputs[, 3]
  
  # Unit Conversion: umol/m2/sec to Mg/ha/timestep
  k <- 1e-6 * 12 * 1e-6 * 10000 * 86400 #mol/umol*gC/mol*Mg/g*m2/ha*sec/timestep

  # Convert leaf carbon to leaf area index
  lai <- states[, 1] * parms$SLA * 0.1  #0.1 is conversion from Mg/ha to kg/m2
  
  # photosynthesis
  #Calculate gross primary productivity as a function of LAI and PAR (convert to daily)
  ## pmax ensures GPP never goes negative
  gpp <- pmax(0, k * parms$alpha * (1 - exp(-0.5 * lai)) * inputs_PAR)

  ## Autotropic respiration & allocation to leaves and wood
  ra <- gpp * parms$Ra_frac
  npp <- gpp - ra
  
  leaf_alloc <- npp * parms$leaf_frac
  wood_alloc <- npp * (1 - parms$leaf_frac)

  # Calculate soil respiration using a base rate and a Q10 temperature modifier 
  #(more soil = more respiration, hotter = more respiration)
  ## pmax ensures SOM never goes negative
  rh <- pmax(k * parms$Rbasal * states[, 3] * parms$Q10 ^ (inputs_temp / 10), 0) 

  ## turnover

  #calculate the daily rate of leaf drop
  litterfall <- states[ , 1] * (parms$litterfall_rate * (365/ (params$litterfall_length)))
  #Not leaf drop if outside the day of the year window
  litterfall[!(inputs_doy > params$litterfall_start & 
              inputs_doy[1] < (params$litterfall_start + params$litterfall_length))] <- 0.0
  
  #kill trees
  mortality <- states[ , 2] * parms$mortality
  
  #Change in states
  dleaves_dt <- leaf_alloc  - litterfall
  dwood_dt <- wood_alloc  - mortality
  dSOM_dt <- litterfall + mortality - rh
  
  #Update states by adding the change
  states[, 1] <- states[, 1] + dleaves_dt
  states[, 2] <- states[, 2] + dwood_dt
  states[, 3] <- states[, 3] + dSOM_dt
  
  ## Add normally distributed random noise to states
  ## pmax ensures states never go negative
  states[, 1] <- pmax(rnorm(ens_members, states[, 1], parms$sigma.leaf), 0)
  states[, 2] <- pmax(rnorm(ens_members, states[, 2], parms$sigma.wood), 0)
  states[, 3] <- pmax(rnorm(ens_members, states[, 3], parms$sigma.soil), 0)
  
  #Derived variables (LAI and net ecosystem exchange)
  lai <- states[, 1]  * parms$SLA * 0.1
  nee <- ra + rh - gpp
  
  return(cbind(state1 = states[, 1],
              state2 = states[, 2],
              state3 = states[, 3],
              lai = lai,
               gpp = gpp ,
               nee = nee,
               ra =  ra,
               npp_w = wood_alloc,
               npp_l = leaf_alloc,
               rh = rh,
               litterfall = litterfall,
               mortality = mortality))
}
```

## Set up model run

### Time frame, site ID, and number of ensembles

In this chapter, we are running a deterministic simulation (no uncertainty) so we only have one ensemble member. The simulation is for a single NEON site (Ordway-Swisher Biological Station; OSBS), which is a longleaf pine ecosystem located in Florida, USA. The simulation will run from `2020-09-30` to two days ago.

```{r}
site <- "OSBS"
ens_members <- 1
sim_dates <- seq(as_date("2020-09-30"), Sys.Date() - lubridate::days(2), by = "1 day")
#sim_dates <- seq(as_date("2020-09-30"), as_date("2025-12-15") - lubridate::days(2), by = "1 day")
```

### Set drivers

I have provided a custom function to access the weather drivers. You can learn more about the function in @sec-driver-functions. My choice to provide a custom function here rather than writing out the complete code is intentional, to avoid unnecessary distraction from the focus on the process model.

```{r}
inputs <- get_historical_met(site = site, sim_dates, use_mean = TRUE)
inputs_ensemble <- assign_met_ensembles(inputs, ens_members)
```

Here is a plot of the meteorological input data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(inputs, aes(x = datetime, y = prediction)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~variable, scale = "free")
```

### Set parameters

The model has 10 process parameters and 3 parameters representing the process uncertainty. Each of the parameters is set below to reasonable values. The process uncertainty standard deviations are set to 0.0 since our simulation is deterministic.

```{r}
#Set parameters
params <- list()
params$alpha <- rep(0.02, ens_members)
params$SLA <- rep(4.74, ens_members)
params$leaf_frac <- rep(0.315, ens_members)
params$Ra_frac <- rep(0.5, ens_members)
params$Rbasal <- rep(0.002, ens_members)
params$Q10 <- rep(2.1, ens_members)
params$litterfall_rate <- rep(1/(2.0*365), ens_members) #Two year leaf lifespan
params$litterfall_start <- rep(200, ens_members)
params$litterfall_length<- rep(60, ens_members)
params$mortality <- rep(0.00015, ens_members) #Wood lives about 18 years on average (all trees, branches, roots, course roots)
params$sigma.leaf <- rep(0.0, ens_members) # leaf carbon process uncertainty
params$sigma.wood <- rep(0.0, ens_members) # wood carbon process uncertainty
params$sigma.soil <- rep(0.0, ens_members) #soil carbon process uncertainty
params <- as.data.frame(params)
```

### Set initial condition

Next, we set the starting point of the simulation. All three states need a starting point. To do this, we create a three-dimensional array to hold the model output, with the dimensions corresponding to 1) the number of simulated time steps; 2) the number of ensemble members (which in our case is 1 because this simulation is deterministic); and 3) the number of output variables. We then populate the first time step in the output array with the initial condition for each state.

```{r}
output <- array(NA, dim = c(length(sim_dates), ens_members, 12)) 
#12 is the number of output variables (states + fluxes + derived variables)
output[1, , 1] <- 5 # air temperature; degrees C
output[1, , 2] <- 140 # PAR; umol/m2/sec
output[1, , 3] <- 140 # day of year
```

## Run model

Loop over the `sim_dates` vector that includes the dates of the simulation. The loop starts on the index of 2 because the index of 1 was set as the initial conditions above. The `forest_model` function is the process model above. At each time step, the output is saved to the output array.

```{r}
for(t in 2:length(sim_dates)){
  output[t, , ]  <- forest_model(t, 
                                 states = matrix(output[t-1 , , 1:3], nrow = ens_members),
                                 parms = params,
                                 inputs = matrix(inputs_ensemble[t ,, ], nrow = ens_members))
}
```

## Plot output

The `output_to_df` converts the output into a data frame and is located in the `R/helpers.R` script in the book repository. The `sim_name` is the name of your simulation.

```{r}
output_df <- output_to_df(output, sim_dates, sim_name = "baseline")
```

@fig-determ-output is a plot of the output data frame.

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Output without uncertainty from the process model 
#| label: fig-determ-output
output_df |> 
  filter(variable %in% c("lai", "wood", "som", "nee")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = datetime)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = prediction, group = ensemble)) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scale = "free") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Problem set

Use the visualization of the simulation above to answer the following questions:

1.  Which carbon state is changing the most over the simulation (wood or som)?
2.  Why does wood carbon increase in the summer and decrease over the winter?
3.  Is carbon stored or released by the ecosystem when NEE is negative? What time of year is NEE positive?
4.  All models are simplifications of the system: What important ecosystem processes are missing from this forest ecosystem model?
