## Overview of model

We use a simple representation of a forest ecosystem that simulates carbon using three pools (leaves, wood, and soil). The model in @fig-process-model is a 0-D model (no horizontal and vertical dimensions) that runs at a 1 day timestep. It models carbon using the units of MgC/ha.

![Conceptual diagram of the forest model](img/model_diagram.png){#fig-process-model fig-align="center"}

Photosynthesis (gross primary productivity; `gpp`) is modeled using a light-use efficiency (LUE) approach. The goal an LUE model is to convert light energy into carbon. First, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is converted to absorbed PAR by multiplying by the proportion absorbed by leaf area index (LAI) <!--# this is confusing; do you mean PAR is converted to absorbed PAR by multiplying by 1) the proportion absorbed and 2) by LAI? could you rephrase to: the proportion of PAR that is absorbed by leaves is a function of LAI, where as LAI increases, the proportion of absorbed PAR increases, or something like that?  -->. As LAI increases more light is absorbed. The absorbed PAR is multiplied by a light use efficiency parameter (`alpha`). LAI is determined by multiplying leaf carbon by the specific leaf area parameter (`SLA`). <!--# I think in this section it would be helpful to have a couple of rendered equations for the more complex processes, specifically GPP and Q10, below their corresponding paragraphs; or maybe you could do it in code if you think that is more approachable; or even plot a curve of the function? just something besides text to help students understand how the process works before they get to the code would be good I think -->

Autotrophic respiration (`ra`) is modeled as a constant proportion of GPP using the `Ra_frac` parameter. Net primary productivity (`npp`) is the carbon that is not used for autotrophic respiration (`gpp - ra`).

NPP is allocated to the two vegetation carbon states (`wood` and `leaves`) based on a constant proportion parameter. `leaf_frac` is the proportion that is allocated to leaves and `1-leaf_frac` is the allocation to wood.

Litterfall occurs between a starting day-of-year (`litterfall_start`) and an ending day-of-year (`litterfall_start + litterfall_length`). The annual proportion of leaves (`litterfall_rate`) that are dropped is removed during this period.

Tree mortality is modeled as a constant proportion of wood (`mortality`) that is lost each day.

Heterotrophic respiration is modeled as a constant proportion of soil carbon (`Rbasal`) that is adjusted by the temperature using a Q10 function <!--# do we assume students know the form of a Q10 function and what it is? otherwise can you provide equation below? --> that is governed by a Q10 parameter (`Q10`)

The change in leaves at each time step is modeled as leaf allocation - litterfall. The change in wood in each timestep is modeled as wood allocation - mortality. The change in soil carbon in each timestep is modeled as litterfall + mortality - heterotrophic respiration.

Finally, net ecosystem exchange (`nee`) is modeled as `ra + rh - gpp` with negative values corresponding to net gain in carbon by the ecosystem.

The model requires inputs of photosynthetic active radiation (`PAR`), air temperature (`temp`), and day-of-year (`doy`).

## Solving the model

At each time step, the processes that result in change in the model states are calculated (i.e., photosynthesis, mortality, respiration, etc.). The process rates are then combined to determine the net rate of change (i.e., the derivative) for each model state.

```         
  dleaves_dt <- leaf_alloc  - litterfall
  dwood_dt <- wood_alloc  - mortality
  dSOM_dt <- litterfall + mortality - rh
```

The net rate of change for each time step is added to the value of the state at the previous time step to calculate the update state.

```         
  states[, 1] <- states[, 1] + dleaves_dt
  states[, 2] <- states[, 2] + dwood_dt
  states[, 3] <- states[, 3] + dSOM_dt
```

This process is repeated at each time step to create a time series of model output. This method is called the Euler method for solving ordinary differential equations and assumes a constant change in time (dt = 1 day) at each time step.

## Model as a function

The code below describes the model as a R function. The function predicts one time step at a time. The same function is found in the `R/forecast_model.R` script in the book repository. The inputs to the function are:

-   `t`: the index of the current model time-step

-   `states`: a matrix of the states (rows = ensemble members, columns = states)

-   `parms`: a data frame of parameters (rows = ensemble members, columns = parameters)

-   `inputs`: a matrix of drivers (rows = ensemble members, columns = drivers)

```{r}
forest_model <- function(t, states, parms, inputs){
  
  ens_members <- nrow(states)
  
  inputs_temp <- inputs[, 1]
  inputs_PAR <- inputs[, 2]
  inputs_doy <- inputs[, 3]
  
  # Unit Conversion: umol/m2/sec to Mg/ha/timestep
  k <- 1e-6 * 12 * 1e-6 * 10000 * 86400 #mol/umol*gC/mol*Mg/g*m2/ha*sec/timestep

  # Convert leaf carbon to leaf area index
  lai <- states[, 1] * parms$SLA * 0.1  #0.1 is conversion from Mg/ha to kg/m2
  
  # photosynthesis
  #Calculate gross primary productivity as a function of LAI and PAR (convert to daily)
  ## pmax ensures GPP never goes negative
  gpp <- pmax(0, k * parms$alpha * (1 - exp(-0.5 * lai)) * inputs_PAR)

  ## autotropic respiration & allocation to leaves and wood
  ra <- gpp * parms$Ra_frac
  npp <- gpp - ra
  
  leaf_alloc <- npp * parms$leaf_frac
  wood_alloc <- npp * (1 - parms$leaf_frac)

  # Calculate soil respiration using a base rate and a Q10 temperature modifier 
  #(more soil = more respiration, hotter = more respiration)
  ## pmax ensures SOM never goes negative
  rh <- pmax(k * parms$Rbasal * states[, 3] * parms$Q10 ^ (inputs_temp / 10), 0) 

  ## turnover

  #calculate the daily rate of leaf drop
  litterfall <- states[ , 1] * (parms$litterfall_rate * (365/ (params$litterfall_length)))
  #Not leaf drop if outside the day of year window
  litterfall[!(inputs_doy > params$litterfall_start & 
              inputs_doy[1] < (params$litterfall_start + params$litterfall_length))] <- 0.0
  
  #kill trees
  mortality <- states[ , 2] * parms$mortality
  
  #Change in states
  dleaves_dt <- leaf_alloc  - litterfall
  dwood_dt <- wood_alloc  - mortality
  dSOM_dt <- litterfall + mortality - rh
  
  #Update states by adding the change
  states[, 1] <- states[, 1] + dleaves_dt
  states[, 2] <- states[, 2] + dwood_dt
  states[, 3] <- states[, 3] + dSOM_dt
  
  ## Add normally distributed random noise to states - WHY? please explain this!
  ## pmax ensures states never goes negative
  states[, 1] <- pmax(rnorm(ens_members, states[, 1] , parms$sigma.leaf), 0)
  states[, 2] <- pmax(rnorm(ens_members, states[, 2], parms$sigma.stem), 0)
  states[, 3] <- pmax(rnorm(ens_members, states[, 3], parms$sigma.soil), 0)
  
  #Derived variables (LAI and net ecosystem exchange)
  lai <- states[, 1]  * parms$SLA * 0.1
  nee <- ra + rh - gpp
  
  return(cbind(state1 = states[, 1],
              state2 = states[, 2],
              state3 = states[, 3],
              lai = lai,
               gpp = gpp ,
               nee = nee,
               ra =  ra,
               npp_w = wood_alloc,
               npp_l = leaf_alloc,
               rh = rh,
               litterfall = litterfall,
               mortality = mortality))
}
```

## Set up model run

### Time frame, site id, and number of ensembles

In this chapter, we are running a deterministic simulation (no uncertainty) so we only have one ensemble member. The simulation is for a single NEON site (Ordway-Swisher Biological Station; OSBS), which is a longleaf pine ecosystem located in Florida, USA. The simulation will run from `2020-09-30` to two days ago.

```{r}
site <- "OSBS"
ens_members <- 1
sim_dates <- seq(as_date("2020-09-30"), Sys.Date() - lubridate::days(2), by = "1 day")
```

### Set drivers

I have provided a custom function to access the weather drivers. You can learn more about the function in @sec-driver-functions. My choice to provide a custom function here rather than writing out the complete code is intentional, to avoid unnecessary distraction from the focus on the process model.

```{r}
inputs <- get_historical_met(site = site, sim_dates, use_mean = TRUE)
inputs_ensemble <- assign_met_ensembles(inputs, ens_members)
```

Here is a plot of the meteorological input data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(inputs, aes(x = datetime, y = prediction)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~variable, scale = "free")
```

### Set parameters

The model has 10 process parameters and 3 parameters representing the process uncertainty <!--# I think the 3 process uc parameters need to be mentioned above where the model function is defined to avoid confusion -->. Each of the parameters is set below to reasonable values. The process uncertainty standard deviations are set to 0.0 since our simulation is deterministic.

```{r}
#Set parameters
params <- list()
params$alpha <- rep(0.02, ens_members)
params$SLA <- rep(4.74, ens_members)
params$leaf_frac <- rep(0.315, ens_members)
params$Ra_frac <- rep(0.5, ens_members)
params$Rbasal <- rep(0.002, ens_members)
params$Q10 <- rep(2.1, ens_members)
params$litterfall_rate <- rep(1/(2.0*365), ens_members) #Two year leaf lifespan
params$litterfall_start <- rep(200, ens_members)
params$litterfall_length<- rep(60, ens_members)
params$mortality <- rep(0.00015, ens_members) #Wood lives about 18 years on average (all trees, branches, roots, course roots)
params$sigma.leaf <- rep(0.0, ens_members) #0.01 
params$sigma.stem <- rep(0.0, ens_members) #0.01 ## wood biomass
params$sigma.soil <- rep(0.0, ens_members)# 0.01
params <- as.data.frame(params)
```

### Set initial condition

Next we set the starting point of the simulation. All three states need a starting point. To do this, we create a three-dimensional array to hold the model output, with the dimensions corresponding to: 1) the number of simulated time steps; 2) the number of ensemble members (which in our case is 1 because this simulation is deterministic); and 3) the number of output variables. We then populate the first time step in the output array with the initial condition for each state.

```{r}
output <- array(NA, dim = c(length(sim_dates), ens_members, 12)) #12 is the number of output variables (states + fluxes + derived variables)
output[1, , 1] <- 5 # air temperature; degrees C
output[1, , 2] <- 140 # PAR; umol/m2/sec
output[1, , 3] <- 140 # day of year
```

## Run model

Loop over the `sim_dates` vector that includes the dates of the simulation. The loop starts on index of 2 because index of 1 was set as the initial conditions above. The `forest_model` function is the process model above. At each time step, the output is saved to the output array.

```{r}
for(t in 2:length(sim_dates)){
  output[t, , ]  <- forest_model(t, 
                                 states = matrix(output[t-1 , , 1:3], nrow = ens_members),
                                 parms = params,
                                 inputs = matrix(inputs_ensemble[t ,, ], nrow = ens_members))
}
```

## Plot output

The `output_to_df` converts the output into a data frame and is located in the `R/helpers.R` script in the book repository. The `sim_name` is the name of your simulation.

```{r}
output_df <- output_to_df(output, sim_dates, sim_name = "baseline")
```

@fig-determ-output is a plot of the output data frame.

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Output without uncertainty from the process model 
#| label: fig-determ-output
output_df |> 
  filter(variable %in% c("lai", "wood", "som", "nee")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = datetime)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = prediction, group = ensemble)) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scale = "free") +
  theme_bw()
```
